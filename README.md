## Web-based Task Manager

doIt is a web-based task manager, I built it using the standard trio of HTML, CSS and JS, in addition to that "date-fns" package was used to facilitate dealing with dates and Webpack was used to facilitate the development process.
doIt allows for the basic features of adding, editing and deleting tasks, tasks are retained using localStorage, it also comes with a mobile-friendly design so it can be used on any device with a web browser.
